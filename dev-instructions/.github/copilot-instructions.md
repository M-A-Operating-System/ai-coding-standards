# GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are working in a project with strict coding standards.
Your behavior must be governed by the documentation in this repository.

## Primary Directives
1. **Always Read Standards First**:
   - Refer to `master_instructions.md` in the root for global rules.
   - Refer to `languages/python/master_instructions.md` for Python tasks.
   - Refer to `languages/typescript/master_instructions.md` for TypeScript tasks.

2. **No Deviations**:
   - Do not suggest code that violates the `forbidden_patterns.md` file.
   - Adhere strictly to the "Relationship to Standards" defined in the language subdirectories.

3. **Context Awareness**:
   - Use the `ai-context.json` or `llms.txt` file to understand the documentation map if needed.
