# Project Context & Standards
# This file provides a map of the project's documentation for AI agents.

# Global Entry Point
- [Persona Selection Standards](persona_standards.md) - START HERE. Select the active persona and apply standards through that lens.
- [Master Standards](master_standards.md) - Global rules (security-first priorities, permission gate, doc hierarchy).

# Situation-Based Routing (Recommended)
1) **Select Persona**: Use `persona_standards.md`, then load the corresponding file under `personas/`.
2) **Identify the Situation**: Use `common_scenarios.md` to pick the right workflow (review, refactor, security audit, docs, deployment).
3) **Pick the Implementation Layer**:
	- For language-specific work, load `languages/<language>/master_standards.md`.
	- For data work, load `data_standards.md` and any database-specific guidance under `data/`.
4) **Cross-Reference Global Standards**: security, testing, ops, tools, docs (as applicable).
5) **Reuse Skills**: Prefer the reusable patterns in `skills/` and orchestration patterns in `skills/agents.md`.

# Core Standards (The "What")
- [Architecture Standards](architecture_standards.md) - The Five-View Architecture framework.
- [Security Standards](security_standards.md) - OWASP/NIST controls and security requirements.

- [Operations Standards](ops_standards.md) - CI/CD, observability, and deployment rules.
- [Documentation Standards](documentation_standards.md) - ADRs, READMEs, and code comments.
- [API Standards](api_standards.md) - RESTful API design and implementation principles.
- [Frontend Standards](frontend_standards.md) - User interface and frontend application standards.
- [Data Standards](data_standards.md) - Data modeling and database standards.
- [Tools Standards](tools_standards.md) - Enterprise tool selection and usage guidelines.
